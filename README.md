# Demo with Node, Express, React, and Webpack

Node and npm handle the server-side components of the app. We will build a basic [Express](http://expressjs.com/) web framework serving [Jade](http://jade-lang.com/) templated files, which is the default for the [express-generator](http://expressjs.com/en/starter/generator.html). 

On the client-side, [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) will be used for the View layer. React lets you write your client-side code in clean javascript components, rather than mucking around with multiple blocks of html and scripts.

See the [blog_post.md](blog_post.md) for more info.
